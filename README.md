# Olympics-Data-Analysis

-- About the dataset
In this project I worked on Olympics dataset which was taken from kaggle. The dataset has two CSV files one 
is about the Athletes and other one is about the regions. The athletes file has 15 columns and over 270K rows,
it has information about the athlete like in which year he/she won the medal, which medal it was, in which sport, event,
olympics, year and much more. The regions file has 3 columns and 230 rows displaying the regions, NOC and notes which was
almost empty and not used in our analysis.

1. to find overall medal tally of each country in every olympics
2. to find number of editions, sports, events, athletes participated, hosts
3. number of events per sport

5. top athletes in Olympics history
6. country wise analysis like which country is good in which sports, their medals won per olympics, top athletes from each country
7. athletes wise analysis like probability of winning a medal according to age, medal distribution wrt sex and women and men participation
in olympics over the years.

code was integrated in streamlit and interactive web app was created.
